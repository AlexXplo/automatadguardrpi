Copy the above script into a new file, e.g., install_adguard.sh.<br>
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you created the script file.<br>
Give execute permissions to the script: chmod +x install_adguard.sh.<br>
Run the script with root privileges: sudo ./install_adguard.sh.<br>
The script will install and set up AdGuard Home in a Docker container using a bridge network. After running the script, AdGuard Home will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.<br><br>

Please make sure to review the script and adjust any configurations to fit your requirements before executing it. Running scripts with root privileges should be done with caution.
